    <h1>Sian's first argument</h1>
    <h2>School uniforms may deter crime and increase student safety. </h2>
    <h3>In Long Beach, CA, after two years of a district-wide K-8 mandatory uniform policy, reports of assault and battery in the district’s
         schools decreased by 34%, assault with a deadly weapon dropped by 50%, fighting incidents went down by 51%, sex offenses were cut by 74%, 
         robbery dropped by 65%, possession of weapons (or weapon “look-alikes”) decreased by 52%, possession of drugs went down by 69%, and vandalism 
         was lowered by 18%. </h3>
    <h3>One year after Sparks Middle School in Nevada instituted a uniform policy, school police data showed a 63% drop in police log reports, and 
        decreases were also noted in gang activity, student fights, graffiti, property damage, and battery. A peer-reviewed study found that schools 
        with uniform policies had 12% fewer firearm-related incidents and 15% fewer drug-related incidents than schools without uniforms.</h3>
    <h3>School uniforms also prevent students from concealing weapons under baggy clothing, [38] make it easier to keep track of students on 
        field trips, and make intruders on campus more visible. Frank Quatrone, superintendent in the Lodi district of New Jersey, stated that 
        “When you have students dressed alike, you make them safer. If someone were to come into a building, the intruder could easily be recognized.”

    <h1>SianPartner's first argument</h1>
    <h2>School uniforms restrict students’ freedom of expression.</h2>
    <h3>The First Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees that all individuals have the 
        right to express themselves freely. The US Supreme Court stated in Tinker v. Des Moines 
        Independent Community School District (7-2, 1969) that “it can hardly be argued that either 
        students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at 
        the schoolhouse gate.” </h3>
    <h3>In Sweden, a government agency called the School Inspectorate determined that uniforms were 
        a human rights violation because “dress and appearance should be considered an individual 
        expression, decided by the students themselves.” Clothing choices are “a crucial form of 
        self-expression,” according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, which also 
        stated that “allowing students to choose their clothing is an empowering message from the 
        schools that a student is a maturing person who is entitled to the most basic 
        self-determination.” </h3>
    <h3>Uniforms take away the ability to use clothing as means of expressing support for social 
        causes. Students at Friendly High School in Prince George’s County, MD, were not allowed 
        to wear pink shirts to support Breast Cancer Awareness Month and 75 students received 
        suspensions for breaking the school’s uniform restrictions.</h3>
